# Notes_App

A simple Notes App created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to create, edit, and delete notes that are stored using the browser's Local Storage. This means your notes will persist even if you close and restart the browser.

## Features

- **Create Notes:** Easily create new notes with a title and content.
- **Edit Notes:** Modify existing notes to update information.
- **Delete Notes:** Remove unwanted notes with a simple delete action.
- **Local Storage:** Notes are stored locally, ensuring persistence across browser sessions.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file handling the logic of creating, editing, and deleting notes, as well as managing Local Storage.

## Usage

To use the Notes App:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/notes-app.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## How it Works

The app uses Local Storage to store and retrieve notes. When you create a new note, edit an existing one, or delete a note, the changes are reflected in the Local Storage. This ensures that your notes persist even if you close and restart the browser.
